# Ising Model Simulation: Personal Learning Project

## Mission

I’m exploring the Ising model on a 2D lattice to deepen my understanding of statistical mechanics and Monte Carlo methods. My focus is on learning how to:

1. **Implement the Ising Model**: Simulate spins on a grid to study magnetic behavior and phase transitions.
2. **Apply the Metropolis Algorithm**: Use this method to update spin configurations and analyze system dynamics.
3. **Visualize Results**: Create heatmaps and animations to observe how the system evolves over time and how energy changes with temperature.

## Key Concepts

- **Ising Model**: A model of spins on a lattice, with interactions determining system energy.
- **Metropolis Algorithm**: A technique for simulating the state changes of the system.
- **Phase Separation**: Study how different temperature regimes affect the system's configuration and energy.

## What I’m Learning

- **Spin Systems**: How spins interact and align on a lattice.
- **Energy Calculations**: Methods for computing system energy based on spin interactions.
- **Monte Carlo Methods**: Implementing random sampling to simulate physical systems.
- **Visualization**: Using heatmaps and animations to visualize lattice configurations and energy changes.

## Code Overview

1. **Initialization**: Sets up the 2D lattice with spins based on a given ratio.
2. **Energy Calculation**: Computes the total energy of the spin configuration.
3. **Metropolis Step**: Updates spin states based on temperature and energy changes.
4. **Simulation**: Runs the model across different temperatures and records results.
5. **Visualization**: Plots lattice states, energy over time, and generates animations to observe the dynamics.

## Requirements

- Python libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `IPython`

## How to Use

1. **Run the Simulation**: Execute the script to simulate the Ising model at various temperatures.
2. **View Results**: Check the heatmaps and energy plots for insights into phase transitions and system behavior.
3. **Explore Animations**: Watch how the lattice evolves over time under different conditions.

## Notes

- This project helps in understanding fundamental concepts in statistical physics and Monte Carlo simulations.
- Feel free to modify parameters and explore different initial conditions or lattice sizes.
