Ising Model Simulation: Personal Learning Project
Mission
I’m exploring the Ising model on a 2D lattice to deepen my understanding of statistical mechanics and Monte Carlo methods. My focus is on learning how to:

Implement the Ising Model: Simulate spins on a grid to study magnetic behavior and phase transitions.
Apply the Metropolis Algorithm: Use this method to update spin configurations and analyze system dynamics.
Visualize Results: Create heatmaps and animations to observe how the system evolves over time and how energy changes with temperature.
Key Concepts
Ising Model: A model of spins on a lattice, with interactions determining system energy.
Metropolis Algorithm: A technique for simulating the state changes of the system.
Phase Separation: The way the system organizes into different regions at various temperatures.
Energy Dynamics: How the system’s energy changes as the simulation progresses.
What I’m Learning
Coding Techniques: Writing efficient code for simulations, handling lattice configurations, and implementing the Metropolis algorithm.
Visualization: Using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create plots and animations that help in understanding the model’s behavior.
Analysis: Observing and interpreting how temperature affects phase separation and energy.
Code Overview
Initialization: Set up the lattice with a specific spin ratio.
Energy Calculation: Compute the energy of the spin configuration.
Metropolis Steps: Update the lattice according to the algorithm.
Simulation and Visualization: Run the simulation and plot results to visualize the dynamics.
Goals
Master Simulation Techniques: Build and run simulations to grasp the behavior of the Ising model.
Visualize Changes: Create clear visual representations of lattice states and energy changes.
Understand Phase Transitions: Analyze how temperature influences the system's organization and energy.
